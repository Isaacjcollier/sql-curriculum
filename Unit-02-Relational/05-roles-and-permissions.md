### Transactions 

A transaction is a formal term for a SQL statement's effects being synchronized with the "current" data in the database. This doesn't necessarily mean that the data is written to disk, but it becomes part of the "current" set of information stored in the database. When a statement's results have effectively been processed in the current state of the database, the transaction is considered to be committed.
